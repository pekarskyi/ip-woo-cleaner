## Practical applications:
- Quick cleaning of the site after importing products, without the need to reinstall WordPress.
- Removal of demo data after theme installation.
- Cleaning the database after deactivating and removing the WooCommerce plugin.

I created this plugin primarily for my own tasks, but then thought: "maybe it will be useful for other WordPress/WooCommerce users as well."
Feel free to use it and test it. I will be happy to receive your feedback and ideas for expanding its functionality.
